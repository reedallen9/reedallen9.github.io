	<p><div class="essay">To the degree that the websites have quality up-do-date modern code, layouts, clear navigation, appealing and fitting colors, and other helpful nuances will determine whether it falls into the good or bad category of websites. 
	The first website is<a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla.com<a/> and it falls into the category of good websites. First, its code uses html5 because it has the doctype declaration at the top of the code. In that sense it is modern. There appears to be no trouble with the validation of the code. There is no use of tables. The layout also makes sense because there is a head, body, and navigation with information in each. Each contributes. This makes it simple and clean to view. There is no scrolling effect, as no one image remains as you scroll down. There are no columns, adding to the simplicity and clarity of the page. There are pictures of cars and you can click on any one of them, and it has a navigation bar that takes you directly to another page. The navigation is clear and you can find the cars you are looking for. Additionally, there are white spaces in some of these pages or between cars. This gives the viewer a break from what may otherwise seem too much with the movement of the driving cars.. The site uses a few major colors: red, blue and grey, which are primarily the colors of their cars and the background. While simple, the colors go together well. There are also other neat nuances, such as the T in the design on the tab of the page, which looks like a dove or dagger. As you scroll down, the page makes simple one sentence claims, like “discover the tesla 3.” The white letters look good against the blue or black background. The Tesla website is good because it is modern, clear, valid, and is pleasing. What sets this sight apart from others is its simplicity and clarity. The giant pictures convey one model at a time so viewers get a visual, one often in motion, of a product.
	The second good website is <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/this-is-sleep"> awwwards.com. </a> It uses
	html5. What sets this website apart is that it conveys a lot of information in a way easy to take in. The code is modern, 
	using html5. No tables are used and everything validates. The layout makes sense. The top contains a navigation bar with 
	many options, and as you scroll down you get more information that clearly has a source. The website won a contest recen
	tly, so you can see how they were rated by which people with colorful circles. There is a scrolling effect, as the menu
	bar remains on the top as you scroll down. The navigation is done well also, as you can click on the many aspects avail
	able to search and they promptly take you another page. The colors are done well, for they are a light grey, white, and
	lighter shades of blue, yellow, red, orange, and green. Instead of using only white space, they use a lot grey space, 
	which matches the color scheme well. It matches their product in a lot of ways because they sell sleep products, and when I think of sleep, I think of dim colors that will not keep me awake. The title of the site is excellently designed and it even retracts as you scroll down into one letter. The site also does other little things well. For example, the first part of the 
	site, when get into it is an appealing picture, but
	as you scroll down, you then get the navigation bar, and increasingly smaller pictures with informat
	ion. It reminds me of a funnel and is incredibly appealing. Because this website uses good colors, has a lot of information, and conveys it smoothly, as well as the fact that is modern with nice design, makes it a good website. 
	<a href="http://arngren.net/">The last website is terrible<a/>. It is a classified website. It is too busy, confusing, the colors don’t 
	match, is out of date, and it looks too sketchy to click on the options. The site uses javascript, 
	and I don’t know much about this program, but it looks like an old program. There are so many random items on it that it looks like trash washed up on a beach. The layout makes no sense, maybe because it is in Spanish and nothing is orde
	red. The site uses mainly white as a color. This is not very dynamic. If the site had many pages with different products on each page, each page color could be catered to the individual product being sold. For example, a green page for
	lawn mowing equipment, or a red page for lipstick, etc.. There is no navigation bar so finding any particular product is difficult. Instead there is just a long index column. The site tries to do little things well. For example, it
	tries to add design. The face of a man is placed in the upper left hand corner with a weird smirk and santa clause
	is located at the footer of the page. The weird sketch is uncomfortable and so is Santa Claus, especially if one
	is not Christmas shopping. Overall, the site is the worst I have ever seen because it is just random pictures of items for sale, crammed together, out of order, old, and creepy looking.
